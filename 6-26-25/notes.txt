Special Index - an index, after removing which, sum of all even-indexed elements is equal to sum of odd-indexed elements.

Question 1:
    Given an array of size N count te number of special index in the array.
    Time = O(n), space = O(n)
    [special_index.cpp]

Question 2:
    Given a string, find the length of the longest palindromic substring
    brute force = O(n^3)
    expand around the center = O(n^2)

    Manacher's Algorithm = O(n) ~~ not done
    [palindrome_substr.cpp]

Question 3:
    Quick sort.

Question 4:
    You are given a permuatation P[1...n] and integer k
    - choose k distinct elements from the permutation
    - remove them, sort them in increasing order & append them to the end of permutation

    - your goal is to sort the permutation in as few operations as possible
    - return the minimum number of operations required.

    e.g. 2,3,1,4 ; k=2      ans = 2..?

Question 5:
    You are given a rotated array and a target. Find the index of the target.
    time = O(log n)

Question 6:
    Find the peak element in an array.
    peak = it is not smaller than its neighbour.
