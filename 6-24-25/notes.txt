Mathematical functions

Question 1:
    find GCD of 2 numbers. (Binary GCD)

Question 2:
    Delete one: Given arr[n], delete one element such that GCD of reamining elements becomes maximum.
    24, 16, 18, 30, 15

Notes:
    LCM
        a*b/gcd(a,b)

Question 3:
    You are given an array of size n, find the numbers of pairs (i, j) such that i<j and 
    LCM(arr[i], arr[j]) > max(arr[i], arr[j]) * 10

Prime factorization

Question 4:
    Array of given size n, count the number of ordered pairs such that, i < j and
    arr[i] , arr[j] share at least one common prime factor.

Notes:
    Modular arithmetic

Notes:
    Euler Totient functions
